Difference b/w constructor & instanceof & typeof
1) constructor if you want to check if the variable is a string, number or boolean and it doesn't matter if it's a primitive type or an object.
2) instanceof if you want to check if the variable is a String, Number or Boolean object and not a primitive type.
3) typeof if you want to check if the type of the variable is a primitive type and not an object.
